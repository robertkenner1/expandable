# Prescient

An AI pattern library exploring provocative experiments in human-AI interaction.

## Purpose

Prescient is a collection of experimental interaction models that push the boundaries of generative AI. These patterns demonstrate the **proactive AI principle**: that AI can be predictive, anticipatory, and naturally integrated into user experiences.

Each experiment explores how AI can interact with humans in specific ways—not as a separate tool you invoke, but as an ambient presence that feels natural and "just there." When done well, these interactions have a distinct feel to them: airy, intuitive, and seamlessly integrated.

## Philosophy

These are radical experiments designed to explore what's possible when AI:
- **Anticipates** user needs before they're explicitly stated
- **Transforms** unstructured thought into structured action
- **Reacts** contextually to what users point at, not just what they click
- **Augments** decision-making without taking control

The patterns are intentionally provocative—pushing beyond conventional UI paradigms to discover new interaction models that could be deployed by feature teams in production applications.

## Experiments

### Depth (`/`)
Progressive content expansion controlled by a single slider. Demonstrates how AI can generate content at varying levels of detail, allowing users to control depth rather than consuming fixed content.

**Pattern**: Adaptive content generation  
**Use case**: Articles, documentation, explanations that serve different expertise levels

### Decide (`/table`)
AI-powered decision-making table that transforms messy pros/cons into weighted, structured criteria. Two models work in sequence: **Organize** (structure unstructured data) and **Rank** (provide recommendations based on priorities).

**Pattern**: Intelligent data transformation  
**Use case**: Complex decisions with multiple options and criteria

### React (`/hover`)
Cursor-level AI that observes and reacts to what you point at. The interface becomes responsive to attention rather than explicit action—AI commentary appears contextually as you explore.

**Pattern**: Ambient contextual assistance  
**Use case**: Learning interfaces, exploratory tools, contextual help systems

## Principles

1. **Proactive, not reactive**: AI anticipates and suggests rather than waiting for commands
2. **Transparent transformations**: Users see and control how AI changes their data
3. **Natural integration**: AI features feel embedded, not bolted on
4. **Lightweight interactions**: Minimal UI chrome, maximum contextual relevance
5. **Experimental by design**: These patterns prioritize learning over polish

## For Teams

These patterns are designed to inspire feature teams exploring how to integrate AI into their products. Each experiment can be adapted, remixed, or used as a reference for building similar interactions.

The code is intentionally kept readable and well-documented (see `TABLE_DEVELOPMENT.md` for an example of the iterative development process) to help teams understand not just *what* was built, but *why* certain decisions were made.

**Note**: Prescient is experimental software. Patterns are meant to provoke thought and exploration, not serve as production-ready components.
