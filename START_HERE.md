# 🚀 START HERE

## Welcome to Article Expander!

This is a demo application that lets you expand content from a headline to a full article using AI and a slider.

---

## ⚡ Quick Start (2 Minutes)

### 1️⃣ Add Your OpenAI API Key

Open the file `.env.local` in this directory and replace the placeholder:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-openai-api-key-here
```

**Don't have an API key?** Get one at [platform.openai.com/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)

### 2️⃣ Start the Server

Open your terminal in this directory and run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### 3️⃣ Open the App

Go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## 🎯 What You'll See

### Single Page Experience
- **Clean, minimal interface** - Only the text content and a bottom toolbar
- **Random topic** - Automatically generated on page load
- **Dynamic text scaling** - Text size changes from 4rem (headline) to 1rem (full article)
- **Bottom toolbar** - Toggle between modes and use the slider to expand

### Try It Out
1. Open http://localhost:3000
2. A random topic is automatically generated
3. Wait for content to load (Pre-loaded mode generates all levels at once)
4. Move the slider to expand from headline → full article
5. Toggle to "On-demand" mode to see real-time generation
6. Refresh the page to get a new random topic
